        * common_package() -> common_find_package()
        * common_package_post() -> common_find_package_post()
    * VERSION_MAJOR, VERSION_MINOR, VERSION_PATCH are now part of project()
    * OUTPUT_INCLUDE_DIR removed; use ${PROJECT_BINARY_DIR}/include instead
    * Per-target include directories and definitions instead of global pollution
    * Qt support is now implicit thanks to AUTOMOC, AUTORCC and AUTOUIC feature:
      NAME_MOC_HEADERS, NAME_UI_FORMS and NAME_RESOURCES are not supported
      anymore; use NAME_PUBLIC_HEADERS, NAME_HEADERS and NAME_SOURCES
      accordingly
* [477](https://github.com/Eyescale/CMake/pull/477):
  Rename functions to common_cppcheck, common_clangcheck and
  common_cpplint to solve a name clash with ITK
* Remove common_gui_application, add GUI and EXAMPLE arguments to
  common_application

# 2016.04

* Add COMMON_OSX_TARGET_VERSION - OS X target version
* Add OPTIONAL argument to git_external. This gives users the possibility of
  cloning a repository without aborting the configuration if the operation fails
* Coverage.cmake fixes:
    * Fix missing coverage report for multiple project directories
    * Rename targets to match PROJECT_NAME-target syntax
    * Exclude only generated files from COMMON_GENERATED_FILES property,
      not everything from PROJECT_BINARY_DIR
* Added new test targets called nightlytests and Project-nightlytests. This
  targets depend on perf tests, and cpp test files with the prefix "nightly".
* Add c++11 noexcept test (CXX_NOEXCEPT_SUPPORTED define)
* Add Findhttpxx.cmake
* Add Sanitizer.cmake for gcc and clang runtime sanitizer support
* Add CoverageGcovr.cmake for gcovr support
* FindGLEW_MX considers GLEW_ROOT as environment and CMake variable
* Fix install in common_library() with subfolders
* Ignore moc and qrc files in coverage report
* Make CPACK_RESOURCE_FILE_LICENSE configurable
* New CompilerIdentification.cmake, resulted from splitting Compiler.cmake
* Remove Findzeromqcpp.cmake, use Findlibzmq.cmake instead
* Remove obsolete GIT_TARGETS_RELEASE_BRANCH
* Remove -DBOOST_TEST_DYN_LINK from all translation units

# 2015.11

* cmake 2.8.9 or later is now required; reduced cmake 3 warnings
* cmake 3 is required for finding a project with find_package() from
  outside the build tree/from the install tree.
* Optimized cmake run speed significantly
* New project-png target generating a dependency graph if graphviz is
  found
* New explicit rebase target to update sub projects and externals to
  configured revision
* FindPackages.cmake should no longer be used; use common_package() for each
  dependency and common_package_post() at last (will write defines.h, hence
  after the last call to common_package)
* New variable COMMON_SOURCE_DIR to define the place for all sub
  projects and externals, defaults to CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR
* Sub projects do not FATAL_ERROR on missing required dependencies, are
  deactivated instead
* GitExternal.cmake:
    * 'user' remote for cloned github repositories (added if GITHUB_USER) is
      used default for 'git push'
    * Added SHALLOW and VERBOSE options
    * new targets *DIR-rebase* and *rebase* to update git externals and sub
      projects
* CommonPackageConfig.cmake replaces PackageConfig.cmake. It uses the
  export(EXPORT) feature from CMake 3 to generate ${PROJECT_NAME}Targets.cmake
  file which provides IMPORTED targets. Client projects should use those targets
  in target_link_libraries() (or NAME_LINK_LIBRARIES if common_library) rather
  than ${PROJECT_NAME}_LIBRARIES.
* New variable NAME_OMIT_EXPORT for common_library() excludes a target from the
  list of exported targets. This replaces the project-wide
  ${PROJECT_NAME}_EXCLUDE_LIBRARIES variable.
* Exported targets provided by CommonPackageConfig.cmake are now generated by
  common_application() and common_library(); generic target hook for
  add_executable() and add_library() does not exist anymore.
* common_check_targets() now adds cppcheck, cpplint and clangcheck targets
  to targets added by common_application() and common_library() instead of
  adding them via add_executable() and add_library().
* Removed legacy RELEASE_VERSION magic
* common_compiler_flags() macro replaces globally set CMAKE_C[XX]_FLAGS; is
  automatically applied when using common_application, common_library and
  CommonCTest
* api.h & version.h/cpp are now generated by common_library, not anymore
  globally per project (COMMON_INCLUDES and COMMON_SOURCES are not needed/used
  anymore)
* Added AppleCheckOpenGL.cmake to check for conflicting OpenGL link
  libraries on OS X
* Added CommonDate.cmake to provide today's date

# 2015.06

* New SubProject module based on GitExternal
* Subprojects share a single copy of CMake/common
* Buildyard bootstrapping mechanism deprecated and removed
* Using "cmake -DINSTALL_PACKAGES=1" installs system packages required by a
  project (Debian/Ubuntu + OSX)
* Added Qt5 support in common_library() and common_application()
* New common_gui_application() for configuring GUI applications (OSX app bundle)
* New common_documentation() for documentation repositories. Deprecated
  generation of index.html by CMake in favor of Jekyll for github projects
* Fixed *doxygen* and *coverage* targets for subprojects, enforce LCOV >= 1.11
* Fixed *cppcheck* and *cpplint* targets for subprojects
* New common_package() macro to find a dependency consistently
* PackageConfig searches for ABI-matching upstream dependencies.
  If VERSION_ABI is not available, fallback to matching VERSION MAJOR+MINOR
* Support for detecting both Python2 and Python3 versions
* Removed LAST_RELEASE variable from projects and use VERSION instead
* Separate unit tests from performance tests
* Arch Linux added to the list of supported platforms
* Multiple fixes for CMake3
* More quiet runs
* Merged and retired CMakeBBP fork
* Removed obsolete components:
    * GNUModules
    * WriteModuleFile
    * BuildLibrary
    * FindDisplayCluster
    * FindFlatBuffers
    * FindTuio
* Windows-specific improvements:
    * Targets are properly organized into folders in VisualStudio IDE
    * Unwanted targets removed from VisualStudio "All Build" target
    * Many fixes for Boost detection
* Mac-specific improvements:
    * common_gui_application() installs a relocatable app bundle packaged into
      a .dmg (if macdeployqt is available)
    * Use C++11 std and stdlib on OSX >= 10.9, C++03 on <= 10.8

# 2014.6

* Flatten git externals in release branches
    Needed for some build services which do not allow to pull in git
    externals at runtime.
* Decouple RELEASE_VERSION from VERSION_ABI. The first is detected
    automatically when build from a release branch or non-git source
    folder. The latter now has to be set explicitely in the top-level
    CMakeLists.
* Add COMMON_USE_CXX03 to disable c++11 features for incompatible
    projects.
* Unify active ubuntu codenames in Ubuntu.cmake
* Denoised output of find_package() generated by PackageConfig
* Match lcov colors to BBP quality metrics
