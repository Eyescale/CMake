# CMake Modules

This repository contains common CMake modules and a collection of find scripts
to locate non-CMake dependencies. To use it, create a .gitexternals file in your
project:

    # -*- mode: cmake -*-
    # CMake/common https://github.com/Eyescale/CMake.git master

Copy [GitExternal](GitExternal.cmake) from this repository to CMake/,
and use it in your top-level CMakeLists.txt as follows:

    list(APPEND CMAKE_MODULE_PATH ${PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake
                                  ${COMMON_SOURCE_DIR}/CMake/common)
    include(GitExternal)
    include(Common)

This will clone the latest version of this repository into your project at
the beginning of the CMake run, and make all its features available. Run the
'update' target (e.g. 'make update') after the first successful cmake run to pin
the git external to a SHA1 tag instead of a moving master tag.

## Documentation

The following CMake modules can be included in your project:

* [Common](Common.cmake) does a common CMake setup, and also includes:
    * [CommonLibrary](CommonLibrary.cmake) *common_library* function to build a
      shared library using a standard recipe and generates header files for the
      library (api.h, version.h).
    * [CommonApplication](CommonApplication.cmake) *common_application*
      function to build an application using a standard recipe.
    * [CommonPackage](CommonPackage.cmake) *common_package* for more convenience
      over find_package and *common_package_post* (last after all common_package
      calls) to generate defines.h and options.cmake for feature checking.
    * [Compiler](Compiler.cmake): Default compiler flags applied via
      common_compiler_flags(), useful default warnings and 'safe' C++11
      features.
    * [GitInfo](GitInfo.cmake) sets variables with information about the git
      source tree.
    * [GitTargets](GitTargets.cmake) *branch*, *cut*, *tag*, *erase*, *retag*,
      *tarball* targets.
* [CommonCTest](CommonCTest.cmake) should be included from a tests subfolder.
      Does a common CTest setup, automatically adding all .cpp files in the
      current folder as unit tests to a *tests* target. It also includes:
    * [Coverage](Coverage.cmake) *coverage* target to generate a code coverage
      report as html, if ENABLE_COVERAGE option is also set. Additional compiler
      flags are set in that case, so it should be enabled only for debug builds.
    * [CppcheckTargets](CppcheckTargets.cmake): *cppcheck* target for
      static code analysis. Also adds all cppcheck targets to *tests* target.
    * [clangcheckTargets](clangcheckTargets.cmake): *clangcheck* target for
      clang-check code analysis. Adds all clangcheck targets to *tests* if
      ENABLE_CLANGCHECK_TESTS is set.
* [CommonPackageConfig](CommonPackageConfig.cmake) generates cmake package
  information files for the project. These files let other CMake-based projects
  locate it through find_package (in config mode, without the need for a finder
  script). Must be included at the end of the CMakeLists.txt, after all targets
  have been added via common_library().
* [CommonCPack](CommonCPack.cmake) Configures the CPack package generator to
  redistribute the project as an installable package. Also includes
  CommonPackageConfig.
* [DoxygenRule](DoxygenRule.cmake): *doxygen* target to build documentation into
  PROJECT_BINARY_DIR/doc. Optional *doxycopy* target to copy the results to
  ../GITHUB_ORGANIZATION/Project-M.m/. Must be included after all other targets.
* [SubProject](SubProject.cmake): This module is automatically included in
  Common.cmake to build several CMake subprojects (which may depend on each
  other), which are declared in a .gitsubprojects file.
  To be compatible with the SubProject feature, (sub)projects might need to
  adapt their CMake scripts. Generally, CMAKE_BINARY_DIR should be changed to
  PROJECT_BINARY_DIR and CMAKE_SOURCE_DIR should be changed to
  PROJECT_SOURCE_DIR. See [SubProject](SubProject.cmake) documentation for
  more details.
  A simple example project can be found at
  https://github.com/Eyescale/Collage.git, and a complex one at
  https://github.com/BlueBrain/Livre.git.

Additional features:
* Users can use "cmake -DINSTALL_PACKAGES=1" during the initial configuration to
  install known system packages (Ubuntu and OS X only).
