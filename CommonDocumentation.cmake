# Configure the build for a documentation project:
#   common_documentation()
#
# Generates:
# * doxygit target
# * install target (optional)
#
# The doxygit target executes Doxygit.cmake as a script in the source 
# directory of the project. It updates the index page, removes outdated
# documentation folders and 'git add' the changes.
#
# Input (optional):
# * DOXYGIT_MAX_VERSIONS number of versions to keep in directory (default: 10)
# * DOXYGIT_TOC_POST html content to insert in 'index.html' (default: '')
#
# * COMMON_INSTALL_DOCUMENTATION if set to ON, generate a 'make install' target
#   which installs all the documentation under share/${PROJECT_NAME}/.
#   Default: OFF because it is called by each dependant project when doing a 
#   regular release build using Buildyard, which can be very time consuming.
